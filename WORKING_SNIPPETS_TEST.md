## üìù **KEY DIFFERENCES FROM PREVIOUS FILE**

‚úÖ **Fixed Issues:**
- **Correct file path**: `september-2025.csv` (not `september-2025.csv`)
- **Only verified models**: Based on your actual data.json
- **Removed problematic models**: Like broken `expensesBySubcategory` combos
- **Clear working vs broken sections**

‚úÖ **All These Models Are In Your Config:**
- Total verified models: 26 models
- All have been migrated to v0.8.0
- All use functions that exist in methods.ts

**Start with these basic ones:**
1. `expenses` + `chart`
2. `portfolio` + `chart`
3. `dividend` + `pie`
4. `portfolioReport` + `table`
