-   Moved documentation to an external page with screenshot and examples and etc.

-   CSV Header should be change to Category and Subcategory (see documentation)

-   Added new methods (sum, difference, splitBy, code cleanup and renaming to match new implementation) still a lot of work to do in that file but I want to merge the current state.
-   Improved Error handling for few cases. (still working on that one as well)
-   Updated CSS a little bit...
