### V0.6.0 - Beta - 2023-10-28

New documentation Link: https://studiowebux.github.io/obsidian-plugins-docs/docs/category/plugin-financial-doc

- Changed naming:
  - Types => Categories
  - Id => Subcategory
  - Types => View (to use : chart or report in the snippet)
- Moved documentation to an external page with screenshot and examples and etc.
- Added toggle button to show/hide extra information about a chart
- Added new reports (difference and sum, this is still under heavy development, I still want to improve that part, but I need to merge.)
- Improved settings, added new options (see documentation for all information about it)
- Added Chart type and configuration (not locked to money anymore)
- CSV Header should be change to Category and Subcategory (see documentation)
- **BREAKING CHANGES:** the default.json has been updated massively to reflect all the changes. (Documentation with updated default configuration: https://studiowebux.github.io/obsidian-plugins-docs/docs/findoc/defaultConfigurations/)
- Added new methods (sum, difference, splitBy, code cleanup and renaming to match new implementation) still a lot of work to do in that file but I want to merge the current state.
- Improved Error handling for few cases. (still working on that one as well)
- Updated CSS a little bit...
- Added test data and two file with a bunch of tests and commands, my goal is to improve the model and make it easy to build new models.

See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG)
